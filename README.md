KTracker is a new progress/stat tracker and reporting plugin for MUSHClient, specifically for Aardwolf
Currently, this plugin is based on a pup tracker unwillingly provided by Endymion, and heavily modified
to provide level tracking, gold tracking, pup tracking, quest tracking, etc.

The current version requires that you have the following plugins installed:
Bast:
broadcast_cp.xml
broadcast_double.xml
broadcast_kills.xml
broadcat_quest.xml

These are available directly from bast's repository along with his other plugins.
